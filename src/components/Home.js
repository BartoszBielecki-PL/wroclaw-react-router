        <h2>City History</h2>
        <p className="introduction">
          The beginnings of Wrocław are connected with a settlement that
          developed at a spot convenient for crossing the Oder River, at a
          crossroads of important and old communication trails coming from
          Southern Europe to the North, to the Baltic Sea and from the West to
          the East, to the region of the Black Sea.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          In the first half of 10th century, the territory of Silesia came under
          the reign of Bohemia, and the settlement, at that time surely having
          the nature of a frontier city, most probably obtained the name after
          Bohemian Prince Vratislaus.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          In the last decade of the 10th century, Silesia was included within
          the Polish borders.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          In 1000, during the reign of Bolesław I “the Valiant” (Bolesław
          Chrobry), a papal edict came out – the oldest preserved, written
          mention about Wrocław, which set the city as the seat of the Wrocław
          bishopric, subordinate to the Archbishopric of Gniezno.
        </p>
        <p className="introduction">Silesian Piasts and the City Council</p>
        <p className="text">
          During the period of fragmentation in Poland, Silesia and the largest
          of its cities became the domain of a new line of princes – the
          Silesian Piasts. Numerous settlements arouse around the ducal city
          located on the Oder islands. At the beginning of 13th century, they
          started gradually transforming into one city organism. This process
          sped up after the Mongol invasion of 1241, during which Wrocław itself
          was also partially demolished. The city was rebuilt based on German
          law. At this time, the German colonists that took over a domineering
          role among the citizens were encouraged by the Silesian Piasts to
          settle in Silesia, who hoped that it would support the process of
          rending their lands habitable. In the second half of the 13th century,
          the city already had brick city walls and a moat. In 1261, in
          compliance with the Magdeburg Law given to Wrocław, a government body
          took over managing the city – the City Council.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          In 1335, after Prince Henry Piast died leaving no descendant, the city
          and Wrocław duchy came, by previously signed agreements, under the
          rule of the Bohemia crown.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          The period of staying under the rule of Luxembourgers generally
          favoured the development of the city, becoming a more and more
          important centre of trade and craft. The period of Hussite Wars and
          later, long years of fights for Bohemia succession after the
          Luxembourg Dynasty died out, turned out to be less favourable for all
          of Silesia and Wrocław. Finally, in 1526, after the death of Louis II
          of Hungary, the King of Bohemia, Wrocław and Silesia came under the
          rule of the House of Hapsburg. It also ended the period of trying to
          restore Polish control over Silesia. A rich city with a large
          territory, at the turn of 15th and 16th century, it started building
          modern fortifications, proper for upcoming era of firearms.
        </p>
        <h2>The Reformation and the university</h2>
        <p className="text">
          In 1523, together with the sermon preached by Johann Hess at St. Mary
          Magdalene Church (kościół Świętej Marii Magdaleny), the reformation
          reached Wrocław, where it found a susceptible foothold. As soon as a
          year later, a majority of citizens, with the City Council taking the
          lead, adopted the Protestant faith. Only the temples and monasteries
          of Ostrów Tumski and some of the nearby settlements turned out to
          remain Catholic. The absolute dominance of Protestant faith was to
          remain stable throughout the following centuries, and this was not
          undermined even during the period of attempts to re-Catholicise
          Silesia by the Habsburgs in the first decades after the Thirty Years'
          War ended. Furthermore, the city managed to avoid mayor damages during
          this war thanks to the attempts to preserve neutrality towards parties
          in the conflict.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          In 1702, Tsar Leopold I established a two-faculty university in
          Wrocław – the Society of Jesus Academy (Akademia Jezuicka).
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          As a result of Silesian wars, starting from 1741, Wrocław and Silesia
          came under Prussian rule. Wrocław citizens greeted the army of
          Frederick II with enthusiasm. Soon, the Prussian king made the
          conquered province “an armoury” of the country, and its capital city –
          Wrocław – one of three capital cities and also a stronghold. At the
          same time, the centralistic Prussian policy deprived the city of the
          self-governance that it had had since medieval times. The increased
          fiscal pressure imposed by the new power, which was only to some
          extent balanced with efficient administration, was also visible.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          In January 1807, the city capitulated to Napoleon’s armies, which had
          conquered the Prussian armies in the field.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          French occupation brought a significant contribution and the
          demolition of municipal fortifications. Therefore, unintentionally,
          the French contributed to lift the barriers in the city’s spatial
          development that took place after the Napoleonic wars.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          Starting from 1809, Wrocław, together with other Prussian cities,
          obtained, as a result of thorough reforms carried out in the country,
          a modern municipal self-government and conditions for unrestricted
          economic development in capitalist conditions. In 1811, a public
          higher school - the University of Wrocław (Uniwersytet Wrocławski) was
          established, whose greatest period fell at the turn of 19th and 20th
          century.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          In the 19th century, the capital city of Silesia, especially in its
          last decades, became not just an important centre.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          Starting from 1842, when the first section of iron railway was opened
          (Wrocław – Oława), the city gradually became an important junction,
          crossroads and, after serious regulatory works on the Oder River and
          building a port at Popowice at the turn of the 19th and 20th century,
          also a floodway system. The city was continuously developing, growing
          and modernising its infrastructure as well as construction resources.
          In 1877, the first horse-drawn tram lines were activated, which
          operated until 1910, and from the 1890s, together with the
          electrification of the city, they were gradually replaced with
          electric trams.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          Academic life. Next to the University of Wrocław, which back then had
          already given several Nobel Prize Winners, in 1910, the Higher School
          of Technology (Wyższa Szkoła Techniczna) was established, and a year
          later – the Academy of Fine Arts (Akademia Sztuk Pięknych). Theatre
          and musical life and, to some extent, fine arts made Wrocław one of a
          handful of the most important cultural centres in Germany.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          In first decades of the 20th century, outstanding and absolutely
          innovative architectural works appeared in the city.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          The city had over half a million citizens. The importance of the
          growing richness of the frontier-city was reflected in the
          continuously growing number of foreign diplomatic representatives that
          were locating their seats in Wroclaw. In 1914, there were as many as
          20 of them.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          During the first World War, Wrocław, lying outside the frontier zone,
          avoided damage, though of course, this did not prevent impoverishment
          of the people and the city’s economy. After the war, new economic
          problems caused Germany some territorial losses to the benefit of
          Poland, which brought about diminishing direct storage of the city.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          In first two post-war years, Wrocław was also an arena for rather
          dramatic events connected with establishing a new political order in
          Germany.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          After the political and economical situation in Germany stabilised, in
          the second half of the 20s, Wrocław re-entered the path of development
          and modernisation. During the years 1924 – 1928, it enlarged its
          administrative borders’ framework significantly. It regained its
          position as an economic and cultural centre. Satellite residential
          estates that were established back then have been considered very
          successful and innovative even today: Popowice, Sępolno, Biskupin,
          Pilczyce, Muchobór, Grabiszynek, Książ Mały and Wielki, built with a
          view to unburden the overpopulated suburbs. The development of the
          city was hindered after 1929 by a huge economic crisis.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          After 1933, industry and infrastructure investment of
          national-socialist authorities brought about, as in whole Germany,
          economic growth in the city once again and contributed to a
          significant decrease in unemployment; however, at the same time, the
          autonomy of the city was significantly restricted. Wrocław was
          developing back then as a wheel in the machine of Hitler’s country,
          which was arming itself to conquer the world. Cultural and academic
          life was significantly restricted. Continuously growing terror was
          used against political opponents and Jewish people, which finally
          turned into extermination.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          After the outbreak of World War II, until 1944, Wrocław remained
          outside the area of direct military operations and even became a
          shelter for a few hundred thousand civilians evacuated from deep in
          Germany and for numerous arms industry plants. At the end of 1944, the
          number of persons staying in Wrocław increased to almost a million. In
          1944, in view of the approaching eastern front, Wrocław was announced
          a closed fortress. In January 1945, the command of the fortress
          ordered the forced evacuation of civilians, in conditions of an
          incredibly cold winter and shortages in transport means, which was
          tragic in its consequences.
